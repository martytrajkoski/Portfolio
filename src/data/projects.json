        "content": "Web application for a German language learning system with the help of courses for which a certificate is obtained according to the level of knowledge A team project with which we created a web application for learning German language. The application is built using ReactJS, ASP .Net core #C, Docker, Stripe and Azure. The app mockup was made on Adobe XD. We managed the collaboration between team members through Jira, making weekly sprints where we assigned tasks to each team member. My part of the project was based mostly on the front-end where I worked on the UI with React Bootstrap, creating components and composing pages, API calls to connect to the database using Axios. I also participated in a large part of the mockup creation for the app. The project was part of the faculty program and we presented it at the end of the semester where we got a grade of 10. More about the project: The project is composed of materials with different levels for learning the German language, for which there is a quiz at the end of each lecture, for which a certificate is obtained depending on the points won. Some of the quizzes are charged, so we use Stripe to process the charges."
